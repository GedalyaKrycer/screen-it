## Objective 

Recreate the provided movie tracker design using html/css/js but preferably with React.  

## Key Features 

* To help with your evaluation and my own production process â€” the entire project was tracked in the above Trello board. This allows further transparency into my workflow, such as [time spent](https://trello.com/c/te2ZPyp6), [tutorials taken when needed](https://trello.com/c/ZQ6hs0bG) and much more. 

* To help simulate my typical design approach, I also rebuilt the provided design in Figma. (Still keeping th original layout spec.) This includes a small design system that has new components, color styles and font styles. Doing so helped streamline the process in the long run when I had to add to the design for additional features. 

* This app has been built with React and uses ES6+ JS, Hooks, Props and a Context Provider. I stayed away from using bootstrap and opted to leverage CSS Grid, FlexBox, css variables and other custom styles.

* This site is also a PWA (Progress Web Application), which allows it to be downloaded to a computer or tablet as an offline "app". It scores 100% across in the board in Google Chrome's Lighthouse report.

* Attention was paid to adding comments to the code to explain functions and creating TOC in longer style sheets.

* In addition to the 640px size, I also took some liberties and added  additional styles for larger / smaller breakpoints. This prevented the layout from breaking, while still staying within the general theme of the design.

* Clicking on a movie result will allow you to delete it or visit the IMDB page. This the IMDB link is accomplished by combining the OMDB API data (via Axios get request), with a query string on the IMDB url.

* Some simple validation has been added to the filters to make sure they are included and to the API request. If no movie exists, then a placeholder is given.

* Avatars show up the first character of up to the first 3 word's. If there are more then two characters the font size gets smaller dynamically. 

* The Movie Name hides overflow and shows an ellipse after a preset width size that changes based on breakpoint.
